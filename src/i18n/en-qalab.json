        "explanation": "In automated testing, the absence of test identifiers is a critical problem that can cause intermittent failures and test instability. Elements without identifiers force the use of fragile selectors like CSS or XPath, which break easily when the interface changes. This results in unreliable tests, maintenance difficulties, and significant increase in debug time. Test identifiers (such as data-testid, data-cy, test-id, etc.) are essential because they are stable, expressive about the test's intent, and resistant to layout or style changes. A consistent identifier pattern ensures tests are robust and easy to maintain.",
